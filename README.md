SparkFun Qwiic 5V Boost - AP3012K
========================================

[![SparkFun Qwiic 5V Boost - AP3012K](banner-repo.png)](https://https://www.sparkfun.com/sparkfun-qwiic-5v-boost-ap3012k.html)

From its Qwiic connectors, the [SparkFun Qwiic 5V Boost - AP3012K](https://https://www.sparkfun.com/sparkfun-qwiic-5v-boost-ap3012k.html) converts the **3.3V** logic-level of the I<sup>2</sup>C signals and boosts the **3.3V** power supply; all to **5V** on its [PTH *(plated through-hole)*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Through-hole_technology) pins. This is handy for connecting any I<sup>2</sup>C device that requires a higher supply voltage for an RGB LED or mechanisms like a DC fan on our air quality sensors:

- [Sensirion SPS30 - Particulate Matter Sensor](https://www.sparkfun.com/particulate-matter-sensor-sps30.html)
- [Sensirion SEN54 - Particle, VOC, Humidity, and Temperature Sensor](https://www.sparkfun.com/particle-voc-humidity-and-temperature-sensor-sen54.html)
- [Sensirion SEN55 - Particle, VOC, NO<sub>x</sub>, Humidity, and Temperature Sensor](https://www.sparkfun.com/sensirion-particle-voc-humidity-and-temperature-sensor-sen55.html)

On the board, we provide `3V3`/`5V` jumpers, which can be used to configure the logic-levels of the I<sup>2</sup>C PTH pins. Therefore, this board can be utilized to connect an I<sup>2</sup>C device that requires any combination of 3.3V/5V for its power and/or signals. Additionally, the [TTL *(transistorâ€“transistor logic)*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor%E2%80%93transistor_logic) used to convert the logic-levels of the I<sup>2</sup>C signals can also implemented with other types of interfaces; such as a serial bus, similar to our [SparkFun Logic Level Converter - Single Supply](https://www.sparkfun.com/sparkfun-logic-level-converter-single-supply.html).

<hr>

> [!WARNING]
> Soldering is required to connect a 5V I<sup>2</sup>C device to this board.


> [!NOTE]
> The boost circuit on this board is rated to source up to a 100mA at 5V output, with 90% efficiency. However, users should note that this limitation is not only dependent on the load being connected, but also the amount of current that is being sourced to the Qwiic connector system.

## Breakout Pins
The [PTH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Through-hole_technology "Plated Through Hole") pins on the Qwiic 5V Boost are broken out into six 0.1"-pitched pins on the edge of the board. These pins are used to connect a 5V I^2^C device to the [Qwiic connect system](hardware_overview.md#qwiic-connectors).

	<div markdown>

	**Power Supply**

	---

	Use either the `5V` or the `3V3` [PTH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Through-hole_technology "Plated Through-Hole") pins to supply 5V or 3.3V power to the device.

	</div>


	<div markdown>

	**Logic-Level**

	---

	Users can modify the [`3V3`/`5V` jumpers](./hardware_overview.md#jumpers) to configure the logic-level for the `SDA` and `SCL` [PTH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Through-hole_technology "Plated Through-Hole") pins.

	*By default, the pins are configured to a 5V logic-level.*

## Qwiic Connector
The simplest method to connect the Qwiic 5V Boost board to a microcontroller and/or other Qwiic devices, is through the Qwiic connector.

!!! tip
	The intended design of the Qwiic 5V Boost board was to be utilized with the Qwiic connector system. However, the Qwiic 5V Boost can also be utilized with other interfaces, similar to how the [SparkFun Logic Level Converter - Single Supply](https://www.sparkfun.com/sparkfun-logic-level-converter-single-supply.html) operates. The only difference is its [TTL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor%E2%80%93transistor_logic "Transistorâ€“Transistor Logic") conversion, which is push-pull and not open-drain.
